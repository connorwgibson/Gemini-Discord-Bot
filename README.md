I’m currently building a Discord bot using Node.js as a hands-on project to strengthen my foundations in IT, networking, and systems troubleshooting.

The bot listens for user mentions, processes requests, and communicates with an external API before responding in real time. Through this project, I’ve been gaining practical experience with:

Client-server communication and APIs

Environment variables and credential security

Event-driven systems and asynchronous workflows

Troubleshooting connectivity, errors, and response handling

Structuring and maintaining a small but real application

Projects like this help me connect concepts from networking and IT, such as how services communicate, how authentication is handled securely, and how systems behave in real-world conditions.
